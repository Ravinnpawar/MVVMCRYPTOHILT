Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern to decouple the conventional dependency relationship between objects.
When it comes to DI in android Dagger always takes a lead. But it is very complex and requires a lot of boilerplate codes in order to set up the Dagger.
So, to overcome this problem Hilt was introduced. Dagger Hilt simplifies the whole process and reduces the unnecessary steps without losing any of the features 
of the original Dagger.

Example
In this example, we will build an android application that will show the list of cryptocurrencies using the MVVM design pattern and for dependency injection, 
we will be using Dagger Hilt.
